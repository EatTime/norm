            NORM PRELIMINARY CODE RELEASE

The NORM code here is still preliminary but a functional "norm"
command-line application can be built which can send and receive
a set of files _or_ a stream piped to/from stdin/stdout.  The command-
line options are not yet fully documented.

The current code only has Makefiles for Unix platforms, but the
code could be assembled as Win32 project under VC++.

The NORM code depends upon the current "Protolib" release.
See <http://pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil> for that code.
