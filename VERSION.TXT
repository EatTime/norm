			           NORM Version History

Version 1.2b7
=============
    - Changed normMessage.[h|cpp] to fix alignment issues
      (and other alignment stuff)
    - Fixed bug in NormCmdCCMsg::Iterator::GetNextNode()
      (might significantly help CC performance
    - Fixed NormServerNode::FreeBuffers() bug which
      could result in seg fault on remote server timeout
      or at app shutdown\
    - Fixed bug where tx_sequence count was being
      incremented for all transmitted messages (The "fix"
      does not yet address separate increment of messages
      sent to different addresses, etc). The bug impacted
      congestion control performance when nodes acted as
      sender _and_ receiver (caused receives to overestimate
      packet loss)
    
Version 1.2b6
=============
    - Added normApi.cpp into libNorm.a (Norm.lib (WIN32)) builds
    - Fixed Solaris build (new protolib code)
    - Included very rough user's guide for "norm" demo app
    
Version 1.2b5
=============
    - Initial release with theoretically-working API 
      (including "Norm Developer's Guide!")

Version 1.2b4
=============
    - Finally remembered to update this file!
    - Added "help" command to "norm" demo app (Thanks Marinho Barcellos!)
    - New rxbuffer mgmnt scheme to better use limited buffer space.
    - Removed explicit rate limit on receiver feedback messages
    - API more complete and established better API naming conventions
      (documentation soon to follow, I promise!)
    - There have been some "cc" tweaks and bug fixes.  
    - NORM RFC 3940 was released and this version is in compliance.
    - Added optional positive acknowledgements for sender-defined
      "watermarks".
    - Fixed multicast leave problem when interfaceName was used for join
    
Version 1.1b9
=============
    - There have been a number of bug fixes since 1.1b3.  This release
      fixes a bug in NormBlockBuffer::Remove() and 
      NormObjectBuffer::Remove(). (Thanks Thava!)
      
Version 1.1b3
=============
    - Started keeping version history.  This release includes
