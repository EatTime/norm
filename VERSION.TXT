			           NORM Version History

Version 1.3b9
=============
    - Fixed ProtoSocket WINVER stuff and NormApplicationMsg::SetContent()
      (thanks to Stefan Titze for these)
    - Fixed issue in NormSession::OnRepairTimeout() where a debug 
      message erroneously dereferenced a NormObject pointer as
      NormFileObject (led to run-time issue in optimized code build)
      (thanks to Charlie Davis once again)
    - Fixed places where NORM_CMD(FLUSH/SQUELCH) messages didn't have
      FEC source block length properly set (thanks to Ron in 't Velt)
    - Fixed misuse of "delete" operator where "delete[]" should have 
      been used instead in "normEncoder.cpp" (thanks to Jon of Totient?)
    - Fixed error in NormQuantizeRate() and NormUnQuantizeRate() functions
      in "normMessage.h".  (Thanks to Julian Onions for getting it right
      in the Ethereal NORM dissector he created).
    - Fixed case in NormObject::NextServerMsg() where old recovered block
      could cause assertion failure (thanks to John Wood for the stress testing)
    - Fixed "normApi.cpp" code that was resulting in NormServerNode reference
      counts not being updated properly (thanks to Jon Dyte for this)
    - Fixed missed initialization of NormServerNode::nominal_packet_count and
      NormLossEstimator2::init members (Thanks to Jon Dyte again).
    - Fixed bug where NORM_DATA messages containing FEC parity content had
      8 bytes of extraneous content appended in their payload (Thanks to
      Jon Jannucci for finding this one).
    - Fixed bug where receiver loss estimate returning to ZERO could result
      in a floating point exception in NormSession::CalculateRate()
      (thanks to Ian Downard for finding this one)
    - Re-ordered NORM_DATA "payload_length" and "payload_msg_start" fields
      to be consistent with revised NORM spec.
    - Corrected the detection of "data loss" when application (or API)
      fails to consume received stream data before it is discarded.
    - Fixed bug where when small "txbuffersize" was set for sender, but
      a relatively large FEC block size was kept, the sender app would 
      not be notified by stream "vacancy"
    - Fixed bug with initialization of grtt_estimate when NormSetTransmitRate()
      was called _before_ NormStartSender()
    - Fixed intermediate issue where flush_timer mis-scheduling caused
      sender to "hang" (Thanks to Scott Bates for quickly noticing this)
    
Version 1.3b8
=============
    - Fixed implementation of NormQuantizeGroupSize() in "normMessage.h"
      (Thanks to David Lucas for finding the bug)
    - Fixed some issues with NORM/Protolib ns-2 support
    - Added API NormGetGrtt() and NormNodeGetGrtt() calls
      to support some application needs.
    - Modified transmission of FEC parity segments such that their
      length is only as big as needed to support the maximum
      sent segment size for the associated block (this allows more
      latitude for stream apps in setting their sender segment
      size and flushing).
    - Added NORM_CC_ACTIVE and NORM_CC_INACTIVE notifications to indicate
      whether receivers are actively providing congestion control feedback
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for the great suggestion)
    - Fixed some floating-point exceptions that could occur in receiver
      congestion control tracking under extreme circumstances.  This included
      enhancement of receiver receive rate tracking.
      (Thanks to Ian Downard for finding these issues)
    - Changed naming of "SERVER" notifications in API to "SENDER"
      notifications to be consistent with the rest of API.
    - Debug statistics now indicate correct nack/suppressed counts
      for silent receiver operation (i.e. none)
    - Refined activity timeout of remote sender
      (still need to give the app more control over resource allocation)

Version 1.3b7
=============
    - Deprecated NORM stream payload flags in favor of "payload_msg_start"
      field per revised NORM specification (draft-ietf-rmt-pi-nom-revised-00)
      This included interpreting NORM_DATA (source segment) messages for
      NORM_OBJECT_STREAM with "payload_len" field value of ZERO as
      "stream control" messages where the "payload_msg_start" field serves
      as the stream control message type indications.  The "End-of-Stream"  
      control message consists of "payload_msg_start" = 0 
      when "payload_len" = 0.  No other stream control messages are yet
      defined.  The next revision of the NORM spec will describe this.
      (Thus for NORM stream purposes, this NORM version is _not_ interoperable 
      with previous versions)
    - Fixed problem where NormServerNode "retrieval_pool" had allocated
      segments one byte too small (although this is OBE with the above
      deprecation of stream flags which is what the byte was used for)
    - Fixed bug where sender objects were not properly "closed" when the
      object table was cleaned upon NormStopSender()
    - Added support to VC++ .Net workspace for building "Norm.dll"
      (NORM as a dynamic linked library) and similarly added option
      to build "libnorm.dylib" for MacOS. ("libnorm.so" for other
      Unix platforms should already work).
    - Fixed NormSetTOS() call.
    - Added option to NormSetPortReuse() to maintain INADDR_ANY binding
      if desired.
    - Refined management of NORM sender stream buffer so sender wouldn't
      prematurely discard buffer stream blocks when alot of small
      segments (smaller than segment_size) were buffered.
    - Added NormStopInstance() call to provide means for multi-threaded
      NORM apps to stop the NORM protocol engine and awake any other thread
      blocked on NormGetNextEvent() to signal shutdown of NormInstance.
    - Also updated code so ns-2 build works and tested w/ ns-2.29

Version 1.3b6
=============
    - Fixed some oversite bugs that crept in with changes in 1.3b5
      (Fixed code related to NormNode/NormObject retain and release)
    - Changed NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY posting behavior to be less chatty.
      NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY now posted _only_ after a call to 
      NormStreamWrite() fails to fulfill a full write request
      (i.e. returns less than the "numBytes" requested to be written)
      This helps prevent build up of these notifications in multi-
      threaded applications that write to a stream in a different
      thread than is fetching events via NormGetNextEvent().
    - Added NORM_TX_WATERMARK_COMPLETED notification and NormGetAckingStatus()
      function to provide API support for optional positive acknowledgment
      (ACK) collection in NORM implementation.  Note that use of
      NormAddAckingNode(session, NORM_NODE_NONE) enables a NACK-based
      watermark flushing concurrent with ongoing data transmission that
      can be used as a scalable application-level flow control mechanism.
  
Version 1.3b5
=============
    - Changed ProtoSocket::GetInterfaceAddress() and related methods on Win32
      to use different system APIs depending on Windows version.  
    - Fixed some details related to compilation with g++ 4.x.
    - Various issues fixed thanks to input from Timothy Chaplin.
    - Fixed some issues where attempt to resync rx stream after long
      outages (at high data rates) called assertion failures
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for finding this one)
    - Fixed problem where, on Win32, the sender GRTT estimate was not
      being updated (in the downward direction) properly.
    - Changes to Protolib & Norm to support build of shared libraries
      (Thanks to Dave Talmage & Timothy Mann)
    - Added "NormSetRxPortReuse()" API and code support to allow 
      (with care) multiple NORM instances on the same host.
    - Fixes to NORM congestion control including:
      1) measurement of "recv_rate" at low transmission rates
         fixed (made sure measurement was over sufficient
         interval at low rates including cc startup)
      2) Re-instated code to reduce rate when feedback stopped
         being received.
      3) Changed to time-based aging of feedback to "deactivate"
         stale congestion control feedback representative state
         kept by sender.
      4) Fixed mis-set of PLR flag as CLR flag and fixed bug
         in updating CC node list upon CC feedback reception.
      (Thanks to Praveen Gopala for prompting all of this)
    - Fixes for Win32 large file support "in normFile.cpp"
      (Thanks to Titze Stefan for this fix).
    - Added "NormSetGrttMax()", "NormSetGrttProbingMode()",
      and "NormSetGrttProbingInterval()" APIs to control
      NORM GRTT measurement/estimation process.
      (Thanks to Dave Lucas for prompting me here)
    - Changed posting of NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY for streams such
      that new postings of this event are made, _only_ after a
      successful call to NormStreamWrite() ... This results in
      reduced posting of unnecessary vacancy events, but now the
      onus is on the app to pay attention to this event, since
      another of it's type won't be posted until the app calls
      NormStreamWrite() with non-zero content length.
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for bringing this to my attention) 
    - Made sure messages from self are ignored unless loopback
      is explicitly enabled (see NormSetLoopback()) even for
      operating systems whose ProtoSocket::SetLoopback() doesn't
      work properly.

Version 1.3b4
=============
    - Added NormSetTxCacheBounds(), see NormDevGuide for details
    - Fixed issue with NormStreamSeekMsgStart() that crept in
      somehow (Thanks to Jody Hagins for finding it).
    - Added code to check that NormFileEnqueue() argument is
      actually a file and not a directory name (Thanks to
      Charlie Shyr for finding this)
    - Fixed NormSession::Open() so that IPv6 works
    
Version 1.3b3
=============
    - Added NORM_TX_FLUSH_COMPLETE notification so the sender app
      can make an educated guess as to when his receivers are
      all happy.
    - Added NORM API sample code in "examples" directory.
    - Added NormObjectGetBytesPending() call for receivers to
      use to monitor reception progress.

Version 1.3b2
=============
    - Added "graceful" stream shutdown option to
      NORM API via the NormStreamClose() call.
    - Embedded FLAG_STREAM_END flag in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This is beyond 
      the current RFC 3940 spec for NORM, but probably
      something to push for addition to the next revision
      of the spec.
    - Embedded equivalent FLAG_MSG_START in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This allows message
      boundary recovery for streams upon FEC decoding.
      Again, this is "beyond" the current NORM spec, but
      probably a good idea (Other stream control functions
      might use this field as well)
    - Added Visual Studio .NET project files

Version 1.3b1
=============
    - Prevented pile-up of TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notifications
    - Fix/optimization to ProtoDispatcher threaded operation
      to prevent possible (although minor) race condition
      during threaded operation.
    - Added NORM API calls: NormSetTxSocketBuffer(), 
      NormSetRxSocketBuffer(), NormSetUserData(), 
      NormGetUserData(), and implemented overlooked
      NormGetDescriptor()
    - Thanks again to Charlie Davis for finding some
      performance deficiencies.

Version 1.2b9
=============
    - Fixed bugs with NormServerNode::retrieval_pool mgmnt
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for tracking these down!!!)
    - Changed ProtoDispatcher thread stuff so threads
      (e.g. the NORM API thread) are only actively
      signaled and interrupted when absolutely necessary
    - Added support for NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notification
       (for NORM_OBJECT_STREAM only at the moment)
    
Version 1.2b8
=============
    - Fixed bug introduced during "alignment" changes
      in previous release.
    - Fixed Protolib WIN32 build issue
    
Version 1.2b7
=============
    - Changed normMessage.[h|cpp] to fix alignment issues
      (and other alignment stuff)
    - Fixed bug in NormCmdCCMsg::Iterator::GetNextNode()
      (might significantly help CC performance
    - Fixed NormServerNode::FreeBuffers() bug which
      could result in seg fault on remote server timeout
      or at app shutdown
    - Fixed bug where tx_sequence count was being
      incremented for all transmitted messages (The "fix"
      does not yet address separate increment of messages
      sent to different addresses, etc). The bug impacted
      congestion control performance when nodes acted as
      sender _and_ receiver (caused receives to overestimate
      packet loss)
    
Version 1.2b6
=============
    - Added normApi.cpp into libNorm.a (Norm.lib (WIN32)) builds
    - Fixed Solaris build (new protolib code)
    - Included very rough user's guide for "norm" demo app
    
Version 1.2b5
=============
    - Initial release with theoretically-working API 
      (including "Norm Developer's Guide!")

Version 1.2b4
=============
    - Finally remembered to update this file!
    - Added "help" command to "norm" demo app (Thanks Marinho Barcellos!)
    - New rxbuffer mgmnt scheme to better use limited buffer space.
    - Removed explicit rate limit on receiver feedback messages
    - API more complete and established better API naming conventions
      (documentation soon to follow, I promise!)
    - There have been some "cc" tweaks and bug fixes.  
    - NORM RFC 3940 was released and this version is in compliance.
    - Added optional positive acknowledgements for sender-defined
      "watermarks".
    - Fixed multicast leave problem when interfaceName was used for join
    
Version 1.1b9
=============
    - There have been a number of bug fixes since 1.1b3.  This release
      fixes a bug in NormBlockBuffer::Remove() and 
      NormObjectBuffer::Remove(). (Thanks Thava!)
      
Version 1.1b3
=============
    - Started keeping version history.  This release includes
      some bug fixes, smoother congestion control operation, etc
      over some of the earlier releases.
