			           NORM Version History

Version 1.3b4
=============
    - Added NormSetTxCacheBounds(), see NormDevGuide for details
    - Fixed issue with NormStreamSeekMsgStart() that crept in
      somehow (Thanks to Jody Hagins for finding it).
    - Added code to check that NormFileEnqueue() argument is
      actually a file and not a directory name (Thanks to
      Charlie Shyr for finding this)
    - Fixed NormSession::Open() so that IPv6 works
    
Version 1.3b3
=============
    - Added NORM_TX_FLUSH_COMPLETE notification so the sender app
      can make an educated guess as to when his receivers are
      all happy.
    - Added NORM API sample code in "examples" directory.
    - Added NormObjectGetBytesPending() call for receivers to
      use to monitor reception progress.

Version 1.3b2
=============
    - Added "graceful" stream shutdown option to
      NORM API via the NormStreamClose() call.
    - Embedded FLAG_STREAM_END flag in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This is beyond 
      the current RFC 3940 spec for NORM, but probably
      something to push for addition to the next revision
      of the spec.
    - Embedded equivalent FLAG_MSG_START in "payload_reserved"
      field of NORM_DATA messages.  This allows message
      boundary recovery for streams upon FEC decoding.
      Again, this is "beyond" the current NORM spec, but
      probably a good idea (Other stream control functions
      might use this field as well)
    - Added Visual Studio .NET project files

Version 1.3b1
=============
    - Prevented pile-up of TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notifications
    - Fix/optimization to ProtoDispatcher threaded operation
      to prevent possible (although minor) race condition
      during threaded operation.
    - Added NORM API calls: NormSetTxSocketBuffer(), 
      NormSetRxSocketBuffer(), NormSetUserData(), 
      NormGetUserData(), and implemented overlooked
      NormGetDescriptor()
    - Thanks again to Charlie Davis for finding some
      performance deficiencies.

Version 1.2b9
=============
    - Fixed bugs with NormServerNode::retrieval_pool mgmnt
      (Thanks to Charlie Davis for tracking these down!!!)
    - Changed ProtoDispatcher thread stuff so threads
      (e.g. the NORM API thread) are only actively
      signaled and interrupted when absolutely necessary
    - Added support for NORM_TX_QUEUE_VACANCY notification
       (for NORM_OBJECT_STREAM only at the moment)
    
Version 1.2b8
=============
    - Fixed bug introduced during "alignment" changes
      in previous release.
    - Fixed Protolib WIN32 build issue
    
Version 1.2b7
=============
    - Changed normMessage.[h|cpp] to fix alignment issues
      (and other alignment stuff)
    - Fixed bug in NormCmdCCMsg::Iterator::GetNextNode()
      (might significantly help CC performance
    - Fixed NormServerNode::FreeBuffers() bug which
      could result in seg fault on remote server timeout
      or at app shutdown
    - Fixed bug where tx_sequence count was being
      incremented for all transmitted messages (The "fix"
      does not yet address separate increment of messages
      sent to different addresses, etc). The bug impacted
      congestion control performance when nodes acted as
      sender _and_ receiver (caused receives to overestimate
      packet loss)
    
Version 1.2b6
=============
    - Added normApi.cpp into libNorm.a (Norm.lib (WIN32)) builds
    - Fixed Solaris build (new protolib code)
    - Included very rough user's guide for "norm" demo app
    
Version 1.2b5
=============
    - Initial release with theoretically-working API 
      (including "Norm Developer's Guide!")

Version 1.2b4
=============
    - Finally remembered to update this file!
    - Added "help" command to "norm" demo app (Thanks Marinho Barcellos!)
    - New rxbuffer mgmnt scheme to better use limited buffer space.
    - Removed explicit rate limit on receiver feedback messages
    - API more complete and established better API naming conventions
      (documentation soon to follow, I promise!)
    - There have been some "cc" tweaks and bug fixes.  
    - NORM RFC 3940 was released and this version is in compliance.
    - Added optional positive acknowledgements for sender-defined
      "watermarks".
    - Fixed multicast leave problem when interfaceName was used for join
    
Version 1.1b9
=============
    - There have been a number of bug fixes since 1.1b3.  This release
      fixes a bug in NormBlockBuffer::Remove() and 
      NormObjectBuffer::Remove(). (Thanks Thava!)
      
Version 1.1b3
=============
    - Started keeping version history.  This release includes
      some bug fixes, smoother congestion control operation, etc
      over some of the earlier releases.
